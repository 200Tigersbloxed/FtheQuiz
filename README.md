## Preface

After Quizlet decided to make their Learn feature paid only, I decided to take it into my own hands and develop my own means of studying for tests/quizes. This is just a fun side project, since I thought it'd be a great way to let my creativity loose, since I feel constrained in code.org's Java Lab.

Contributions are welcome!
